# AirplaneModeProof Sample

This repository contains the sample code for my talk "Creating airplane mode proof Xamarin applications". This app shows you how to add more network resilience and optimisations to your mobile apps by using libaries as [Refit](https://github.com/paulcbetts/refit), [Akavache](https://github.com/akavache/Akavache), [FFImageLoading](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading), [Connectivity](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/ConnectivityPlugin) and [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly). 

The server code is included (note: it is flawed by design!), but you can also use the hosted version: http://airplanemodeproof-api.azurewebsites.net/api/
